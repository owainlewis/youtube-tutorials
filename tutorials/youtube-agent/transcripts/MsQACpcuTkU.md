If you're still using AI in the browser, you're doing it the slow way. You see each of these apps has a terminal version and they make me 10 times faster. I'm getting so much work done and the AI companies are kind of quiet about this. They're marketing these tools to developers for code, but here's what they're not telling you. You can use them for everything and it's way better than their apps. Writing research projects, working in the terminal is a superpower. I'm about to show you why I'm literally writing this video with these tools right now and most people have no idea this is a thing, but I'm telling you, once you see AI in the terminal, you're never going back to the browser, so get your copy ready. We're going to my favorite place, the terminal, but hold up before we go there.

I know what you're thinking, Chuck. I use AI just fine. Do you tell me if this sounds like you because this is how I used to use ai. You're in the browser app, you're asking questions, research mode. You're diving deep into a project, can't even see your scroll bar anymore, and this is your fifth chat because chat GBT lost its context or it's mine. You also created a few more chats with Claude and Gemini to make sure chat GBT wasn't lying and yeah, you tried to copy and paste some stuff into your notes app to keep track That never works. At this point, your project is a mess. Spread over 20 chats, two deep research sessions and scattered notes. There's a better way to do this. Hear me out, attend the terminal.

Now we're not going to waste any time we're diving straight into the terminal and I know you probably have some questions. Put those in your pocket for a second and we'll address those, but I first just want to show you what it looks like. I want you to try it so you can know it's not really scary. The terminal's a fun place and we're going to play with Gemini CLI first. Why? Because it has a very generous free tier. That's right. You heard it free and I'll show you claw code in a second. That's my favorite by far Overpowered, but they share a lot of the same concepts. Let's just get you going. We can install it with one command now go ahead and launch a terminal. It doesn't really matter where you launch it. Mac, windows, Linux, all these terminal apps work everywhere. Great for me. I'm going to use Windows with WSL or the Windows subsystem for Linux. If you have no idea what that is, it's totally fine. I got a video right here, so I'll launch my Ubuntu terminal, zoom in so you guys can see, and we'll copy and paste this command installing Google Gemini CLI. Ready, set, go Coffee break.

While that goes, never checked our coffee and if you run into a scary issue, run it with pseudo just like this and if you're on Mac, you can also use Brew Brew. Install Gemini dash CLI. Now it's installed. Before we launch it, we're going to make a new directory, M-K-D-I-R. Then we'll call it coffee project just like this and let's jump in there. CV Coffee Project. Now we can launch Gemini. You'll see why I did this here in a second. Type in Gemini. One word. Ready, set, go. We're here now first, isn't that logo just awesome? I love the terminal. It's so nostalgic.

Now first thing you'll do is get logged in with your Google account. Everyone has a Google account and yes, this can be a free regular Gmail account. This can open your browser. Sign in and I'm logged in. Now don't be scared. Go ahead, ask it a question like how do I make the best cup of coffee in the world? I love the little messages that give us herding digital cats. It's doing a Google search right now, pretty sick, crafting the guide and then it responds just like we're used to. That wasn't so bad was it?

But notice some superpowered things. First of all, we got Gemini two five Pro, the latest and greatest model. Also, the browser doesn't show you this 99% context left. Every chat you have with AI has a context window. The browser hides it from you and the terminal does not. Also, your browser can't do this watch. I really want you to find the best way to make coffee research the top 10 sites, only reputable sources, and then compile the results into a document named Best Coffee method.md and then create me a blog plan, just an outline. I'll do the writing ready, set and go.

Alright, now it's asking us a question. Do you want me to write a file for you? Do you want me to create a file for you? Yeah, dude, go for it. This thing can do everything a browser can do, but it has a superpower. It can access your computer, it can read and write files like I'm not copying and pasting this. It's doing it for me. I mean look, it actually made files on our computer. There they are. Best Coffee Method coffee blog. Think about that for a second. It can access your obsidian vault, all your notes because those are just files sitting there on your hard drive. It can run Bash and Python scripts. It can do mostly everything because we broke it out of the browser.
