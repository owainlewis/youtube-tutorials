[music] All right, good morning and thank you for having us again. Last time we were here, we're still figuring out what an agent even is. Today, many of us are using agents on a daily basis. But we still notice gaps. We still have slots, right? Agents have intelligence and capabilities, but not always expertise that we need for real work. I'm Barry. This is Mahes. We created agent skills. In this talk, we'll show you why we stopped building agents and started building skills instead. A lot of things have changed since our last talk. MCP became the standard for agent connectivity. Cloud Code, our first coding agent, launched to the world and our cloud agent SDK now provides a production ready agent out of the box. We have a more mature ecosystem and we're moving towards a new paradigm for agents. That paradigm is a tighter coupling between the model and a runtime environment. Put simply, we think code is all we need. We used to think agents in different domains will look very different. Each one will need its own tools and scaffolding and that means we'll have a separate agent for each use case for each domain. Well, customization is still important for each domain. The agent underneath is actually more universal than we thought. What we realized is that code is not just a use case but the universal interface to the digital world. After we built cloud code, we realized that cloud code is actually a general purpose agent. Think about generating a financial report. The model can call the API to pull in data and do research. It can organize that data in the file system. It can analyze it with Python and then synthesize the insight in old file format all through code. The core scaffolding can suddenly become as thin as just bash and file system which is great and really scalable. But we very quickly run into a different problem and that problem is domain expertise. Who do you want doing your taxes? Is it going to be Mahesh, the 300 IQ mathematical genius, or is it Barry, an experienced tax professional, right? I would pick Barry every time. I don't want Mahesh to figure out the 2025 tax code from first principles. I need consistent execution from from a domain expert. As agents today are a lot like Mahes. They're brilliant, but they lack expertise. They can do no more slow. They can do amazing things when you really put in the effort and give proper guidance, but they're often missing the important context up front. They can't really absorb your expertise super well, and they don't learn over time. That's why we created agent skills. Skills are organized collections of files that package composable procedural knowledge for agents. In other words, they're folders. This simplicity is deliberate. We want something that anyone human or agent can create and use as long as they have a computer. These also work with what you already have. You can version them in Git, you can throw them in Google Drive and you can zip them up and share with your team. We have used files for uh as a primitive for decades and we like them. So why change now? Because of that skills can also include a lot of scripts as tools. Traditional tools have pretty obvious problems. Some tools have poorly written instructions and are pretty ambiguous and when the model is struggling, it can't really make a change to the tool. So, it's just kind of stuck with a code start problem and they always live in the context window. Code solves some of these issues. It's self-documenting. It is modifiable and can live in the file system until they're really needed and used. Here's an example of a script inside of a skill. We kept seeing Claude write the same Python script over and over again to apply styling to slides. So we just ask cloud to save it inside of the skill as a tool for his version for his future self. Now we can just run the script and that makes everything a lot more consistent and a lot more efficient. At this point skills can contain a lot of information and we want to protect the context window so that we can fit in hundreds of skills and make them truly composable. That's why skills are progressively disclosed. At runtime, only this metadata is shown to the model just to indicate that he has the skill. When an agent needs to use a skill, it can read in the rest of the skill.md, which contains the core instruction and directory for the rest of the folder. Everything else is just organized for ease of access. So that's all skills are. They're organized folders with scripts as tools. Since our launch five weeks ago, this very simple design has translated into a very quickly growing ecosystem of thousands of skills. And we've seen this be split across a couple of different types of skills. There are foundational skills, third party skills created by partners in the ecosystem, and skills built within an enterprise and within teams. To start, foundational skills are those that give agents new general capabilities or domain specific capabilities t... [truncated]
