# Script Writing Guide

## Structure

Every video needs three things:

1. **Hook** (0:00-0:45) — Why should I watch this?
2. **Content** (0:45-end) — Deliver the value
3. **CTA** (last 30s) — What should I do next?

## The Hook

You have 30 seconds. Open with one of these:

### Problem-Solution Hook
> "If you want to [goal], right now you're stuck between two terrible options. [Option A problems]. Or [Option B problems]. Both are wrong. In this video, I'll show you [solution]."

### Contrarian Hook
> "I [impressive credential], and I'm going to tell you why [common advice] is wrong. Before you click off—hear me out."

### Hype vs Reality Hook
> "Everyone's talking about [topic]. But here's the hard truth: [honest assessment]. Let me show you what actually works."

### If I Started Over Hook
> "When I first started [doing X], I [common mistake]. If I could start over, I'd do it completely differently. Here's what I learned."

## Content Structure

### For Tutorials
1. Show the end result first
2. Explain why it matters
3. Walk through step by step
4. Recap what we built

### For Concepts
1. What is it? (simple definition)
2. Why does it matter? (stakes)
3. How does it work? (breakdown)
4. How do you use it? (application)

### For Comparisons
1. The decision you're facing
2. Option A: pros, cons, when to use
3. Option B: pros, cons, when to use
4. My recommendation and why

## Writing Style

- **Conversational.** Write like you talk.
- **Short sentences.** One idea per sentence.
- **No filler.** Cut "basically", "actually", "really", "just".
- **Active voice.** "I'll show you" not "You will be shown".
- **Specific.** Numbers, names, examples. Not vague claims.

## Formatting

Don't overformat scripts. They're for speaking, not reading.

```markdown
## Section Name

First point I want to make.

Second point.

[SHOW SCREEN: terminal with command]

Now let me demonstrate.
```

Use `[BRACKETS]` for:
- Screen recordings: `[SHOW SCREEN: description]`
- B-roll: `[B-ROLL: typing, coffee, etc]`
- Beats/pauses: `[BEAT]`

## CTAs

One primary CTA at the end. Make it specific:

- "Link to the full guide in the description"
- "Try this yourself—make a folder, write an AGENTS.md, point Claude at it"
- "If you want to go deeper, check out [product]"

Don't beg for likes and subscribes mid-video.

## Length Guidelines

| Video Type | Target Length |
|------------|---------------|
| Quick tip | 3-5 min |
| Tutorial | 8-15 min |
| Deep dive | 15-25 min |
| Course/Guide | 30-60 min |

Shorter is almost always better. Cut ruthlessly.
