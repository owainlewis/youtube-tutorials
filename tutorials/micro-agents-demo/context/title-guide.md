# Title Writing Guide

## Principles

1. **Curiosity over clickbait.** Make them want to know more, not feel tricked.
2. **Clarity over cleverness.** They should know what the video is about.
3. **Keywords matter.** Put searchable terms near the front.
4. **50-60 characters.** Truncates after that on mobile.

## What to Avoid

- **Vague titles:** "My Thoughts on AI" — about what specifically?
- **All caps:** "THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING" — feels desperate
- **Excessive punctuation:** "Wait... WHAT?!" — amateur hour
- **Misleading claims:** Don't promise what you don't deliver
- **Jargon without context:** "MCP + RAG + CoT = AGI" — who is this for?

## Process

1. Write 10 title options
2. Check: Would I click this? Do I know what it's about?
3. Run the top 3 through: Is this searchable? Is it too long?
4. Pick the one with best curiosity + clarity balance

## Title + Thumbnail

The title and thumbnail are one unit. They should:
- Not repeat the same words
- Work together to create curiosity
- Thumbnail = emotion/visual, Title = information/promise
